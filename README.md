# Neural Network - Binary Classification

## Participants: Davy Pedro, Tales Nobre

# Goal:

## Implement an elementary neural network capable of performing a binary classification

# Methods:

## The method used was supervised learning. In this case, we have two inputs (x1, x2) and one output, called (y)

# Data:

## The data used was the "alc28_2_classes.txt" file available in this repository.
